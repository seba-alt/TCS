Teams that are faster, more adaptive, and actually enjoy working together. Higher business agility, product agility, and team agility—measured in outcomes, not buzzwords.\nSide effects may include: spontaneous collaboration, reduced eye-rolling in meetings, and the occasional outbreak of genuine enthusiasm.\n\nWhat I offer:\n- Real coaching, not just training—tailored to your context, always hands-on, and never a death-by-slidedeck experience.\n- Practical, conversation- and exercise-driven agile and Professional Scrum Trainings - Agile Leadership, Scrum Mastery, Product Ownership, and more.\n\nWhy me?\nI bring optimism, energy, dry humor, passion, and a relentless focus on learning and improvement.
