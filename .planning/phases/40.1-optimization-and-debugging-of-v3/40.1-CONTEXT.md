# Phase 40.1: Optimization and Debugging of v3 - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Fix bugs, optimize performance, and polish the v3.0 Netflix Browse & Agentic Navigation experience. Covers both Browse page and Explorer for visual consistency. No new features — this is about making what exists work correctly and look polished.

## Implementation Decisions

### Known Bugs
- BrowseCard layout/sizing is off — cards don't display correctly (not a photo-loading issue, but layout/sizing problems)
- Hero banner photos not loading — profile pictures are small/portrait-oriented and don't work as banner imagery; rethink the banner approach entirely
- Hero banner direction: replace photo-based hero with abstract/branded hero — use brand imagery, abstract gradients, or illustration rather than individual expert profile photos
- Text contrast too low — names, rates, or tags are hard to read against their backgrounds
- No mobile-specific bugs at this time — focus on desktop

### Performance
- Browse page content loads in visible chunks (rows appear staggered) — optimize for smoother initial render so content appears together
- Images should lazy-load as rows scroll into view — prioritize fast initial render
- Acceptable load time: whatever's reasonable — noticeably faster than current state

### UX Polish & Visual
- Card content spacing is off — name, rate, tags inside cards feel cramped or unevenly positioned
- General spacing/alignment pass needed across the entire Browse page
- Both Browse AND Explorer pages should receive visual polish for consistency — they should feel like the same app
- Color scheme adjustment for clarity — improve text contrast and readability across both pages
- Brand assets (logo, colors, fonts, PDF guidelines) are in the `frontend/` folder — align visual polish to these

### Claude's Discretion
- Browse data caching strategy (cache between Browse↔Explorer navigation or re-fetch)
- Exact animation/transition polish approach
- Loading skeleton and error state handling
- Specific image loading implementation (intersection observer, native lazy, etc.)
- Compression and bundling optimizations

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Hero banner should use abstract/branded imagery — gradients, brand illustration, not expert profile photos
- Brand guidelines PDF and logo assets are in the `frontend/` folder — use these as the source of truth for colors, fonts, and visual identity
- The app is deployed and live on Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend) — ALLOWED_ORIGINS is configured
- All issues observed are consistent between local and production — no environment-specific bugs

</specifics>

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
