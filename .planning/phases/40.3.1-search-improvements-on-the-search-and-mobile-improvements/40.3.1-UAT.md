## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Search Autocomplete Dropdown
expected: Type 2+ characters in the search bar. After ~300ms, a dropdown appears below the search bar with up to 5 suggestions (job titles, companies, and/or domain tags). The expert grid does NOT update while typing.
result: pass

### 2. Suggestion Selection Updates Grid
expected: Click a suggestion from the dropdown. The search bar fills with the selected text, the dropdown closes, and the expert grid updates to show matching results.
result: pass

### 3. Enter Key Triggers Search
expected: Type a search term and press Enter. The expert grid updates with matching results. The dropdown closes.
result: pass

### 4. X Clear Button
expected: When text is in the search bar, an X button appears on the right side. Clicking it clears the search text and resets the grid. Any active filter chips (tags, rate, saved) remain active.
result: pass

### 5. Keyboard Navigation on Dropdown
expected: With the dropdown open, press ArrowDown/ArrowUp to highlight suggestions. The highlighted suggestion has a purple background. Press Enter to select the highlighted suggestion. Press Escape to close the dropdown.
result: pass

### 6. Mobile Card Tap-Expand
expected: On mobile viewport (375px): cards display 2 per row. Tapping a card expands it to show domain tags and match reason (within the same card height). The card gets a purple ring. Tapping the expanded card again opens the expert's profile link.
result: issue
reported: "pass but the card should be enlarged a little as well since not all is readable also match via can be skipped in mobile"
severity: minor

### 7. Sage Mobile Bottom Sheet
expected: On mobile viewport: a Sage FAB is visible at bottom-right. Tapping it opens a bottom sheet at ~60% screen height with Sage chat. The sheet is NOT draggable — only a close button (X) at top-right dismisses it.
result: pass

### 8. Sage Auto-Close After Discovery
expected: On mobile, open Sage sheet and ask a discovery question (e.g., "find me a marketing expert"). After results load, the bottom sheet auto-closes after ~2 seconds so you can see the filtered grid.
result: pass

### 9. Desktop Sage Panel (No Regression)
expected: On desktop viewport: clicking the Sage FAB opens the existing side panel (not a bottom sheet). The panel works as before — chat, streaming, close button.
result: pass
