## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. BrowseCard Bottom Alignment
expected: On the Browse page, all BrowseCards in a row should have their name, hourly rate, and tags pinned to the bottom of the card overlay — consistently aligned regardless of content above.
result: issue
reported: "no the name and the rate is still on differt heights (due to the tags)"
severity: major

### 2. First Card Left Spacing
expected: The first card in each Browse row should sit clearly past the left fade overlay edge — no content hidden behind the gradient fade on the left side.
result: issue
reported: "still the same as before"
severity: major

### 3. Hero Banner Taglines
expected: The Browse hero banner shows a domain-specific tagline above the featured expert's name (e.g., AI-related tagline for AI experts, design tagline for designers). The tagline renders in the gradient area filling the open space.
result: pass

### 4. Email Gate on Browse
expected: Clicking a BrowseCard to view a profile triggers the newsletter email gate modal (same as the Explorer/Marketplace page). After submitting email, the profile opens. Returning users who already submitted are not gated again.
result: pass

### 5. Sage Search on Browse
expected: Using the Sage AI search on the Browse page returns relevant expert results. Sage should reliably call the search function for discovery queries without stale filter interference.
result: pass

### 6. Profile Photos on ExpertCard
expected: In the Explorer, ExpertCards show a small circular profile photo (avatar) to the left of the expert's name when a photo exists. Cards with no photo show no placeholder — just the name without extra space.
result: pass

### 7. Clear All Pill Styling
expected: In the Explorer filter chips area, the "Clear All" option appears as a rounded pill with a red tint (red background/text) rather than a plain text link. It should visually stand out as a destructive action.
result: issue
reported: "pass but must also be there with sage search"
severity: major

### 8. Bookmark / Save Expert
expected: Each ExpertCard in the Explorer has a bookmark icon (right side). Clicking it fills the icon with purple, indicating the expert is saved. Clicking again un-saves (outline only). Saved state persists across page refreshes (localStorage).
result: pass

### 9. Saved Filter Pill
expected: When one or more experts are bookmarked, a "Saved (N)" pill appears in the FilterChips area showing the count. Clicking it filters the grid to show only saved experts. Clicking again shows all experts. The pill disappears when no experts are saved.
result: issue
reported: "no do not see it but must be a dedicated saved expert button on the top right so it is very clear also in mobile"
severity: major

## Gaps

- truth: "BrowseCards have name, rate, tags consistently aligned at bottom"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: no the name and the rate is still on differt heights (due to the tags)"
  severity: major
  test: 1
  root_cause: "justify-end is inert on shrink-wrapped overlay — tags (opacity-0, not display:none) still occupy layout space, pushing name/rate up differently per card"
  artifacts:
    - path: "frontend/src/components/browse/BrowseCard.tsx"
      issue: "flex-col justify-end on overlay with no fixed height does nothing; tags use opacity-0 not hidden"
  missing:
    - "Use flex-col-reverse so name/rate pin to bottom and tags grow upward into gradient"
  debug_session: ".planning/debug/browse-card-name-rate-misalignment.md"

- truth: "First card in Browse row sits past the left fade overlay edge"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: still the same as before"
  severity: major
  test: 2
  root_cause: "Left fade overlay is w-16 (64px) but scroll padding is only pl-8 (32px) on mobile and pl-16 (64px = equal, not past) on desktop"
  artifacts:
    - path: "frontend/src/components/browse/BrowseRow.tsx"
      issue: "Line 54: overlay w-16 (64px); Line 69: pl-8 md:pl-16 — padding does not exceed overlay width"
  missing:
    - "Increase scroll padding to pl-20 (80px) on all breakpoints so first card clears the 64px fade overlay"
  debug_session: ".planning/debug/browse-row-first-card-behind-fade.md"

- truth: "Clear All pill appears when Sage search is active"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: pass but must also be there with sage search"
  severity: major
  test: 7
  root_cause: "Clear All button gated on chips.length > 0, but Sage injects results directly without setting any filter fields — so chips.length stays 0"
  artifacts:
    - path: "frontend/src/components/marketplace/FilterChips.tsx"
      issue: "Line 94: condition only checks chips.length, not sageMode"
  missing:
    - "Change condition to (chips.length > 0 || sageMode) — sageMode already available in component"
  debug_session: ".planning/debug/clear-all-pill-sage-mode.md"

- truth: "Saved experts accessible via dedicated button visible on mobile"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: no do not see it but must be a dedicated saved expert button on the top right so it is very clear also in mobile"
  severity: major
  test: 9
  root_cause: "Three issues: (1) getSavedCount() is non-reactive (plain function, no re-render signal), (2) early-return guard hides FilterChips when total=0, (3) pill buried in content area, not in mobile toolbar"
  artifacts:
    - path: "frontend/src/components/marketplace/FilterChips.tsx"
      issue: "Non-reactive getSavedCount(); early-return hides strip when total=0"
    - path: "frontend/src/components/marketplace/ExpertCard.tsx"
      issue: "handleBookmark only updates local state, no global signal"
    - path: "frontend/src/pages/MarketplacePage.tsx"
      issue: "Mobile toolbar has no Saved button slot"
  missing:
    - "Move saved bookmarks into Zustand for reactivity"
    - "Add dedicated bookmark button in mobile toolbar top-right"
    - "Button reads savedCount from store and toggles savedFilter"
  debug_session: ".planning/debug/saved-pill-not-visible.md"
