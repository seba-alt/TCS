# Phase 40.2: UAT Fixes and Browse/Explorer Enhancements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Fix UAT issues from phase 40.1 and add enhancements to Browse and Explorer pages. Covers: BrowseCard alignment fixes, hero banner content, email gate on Browse, Sage search reconnection to hybrid search, Explorer save/bookmark feature, Explorer profile pictures, and Clear All pill styling. No new pages or backend endpoints beyond what's needed to support these changes.

## Implementation Decisions

### Browse Card Fixes
- Name, rate, and tags pinned to the bottom of each card — consistent alignment across all cards in a row regardless of content length
- First card in each row needs left margin/padding away from the edge — Claude decides appropriate spacing

### Hero Banner Content
- Category-specific taglines in the hero banner — each category row's hero displays a unique tagline related to that domain (e.g. "Find your next AI expert")
- Fills the open space in the gradient-only hero

### Email Gate on Browse
- Same email gate as Explorer — reuse the exact same component and trigger logic
- Identical behavior to Explorer implementation

### Sage Search Fix
- Sage FAB/popover is visible on Browse but broken — responds with generic answers, almost never finds results
- Fix: wire Sage queries on Browse through the same FAISS + keyword hybrid search pipeline that powers Explorer
- Behavior should be identical to Explorer Sage — same hybrid search + navigate_to flow
- When Sage finds results on Browse, navigate to Explorer showing search results (no category context preserved)
- Use existing Sage FAB/popover from Phase 39 — just fix the search backend connection

### Explorer Profile Pictures
- Small circle avatar (32-36px) to the left of the expert name in each expert row
- If no profile photo: hide the circle entirely — no placeholder, name shifts left
- Use the same photo proxy endpoint that BrowseCards use

### Explorer Clear All Button
- Style as a pill matching existing filter tag pills — same rounded shape, similar size, consistent styling

### Explorer Save/Bookmark
- Bookmark icon (outline that fills when saved) at the right edge of each expert row
- Storage: localStorage (no backend needed)
- Access saved experts via a "Saved" filter toggle/pill in Explorer
- Explorer only — no save indicators on Browse page

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact hero banner tagline text per category
- BrowseCard first-card left margin amount
- Bookmark icon animation/transition on toggle
- Exact positioning of bookmark icon within expert row

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Hero taglines should feel relevant to each category domain, not generic
- Bookmark icon should feel professional (LinkedIn-style), not social media
- Profile pictures should be minimal — small enough to not dominate the expert row
- The "Saved" filter in Explorer should work like other filter toggles — pill/tag style

</specifics>

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
