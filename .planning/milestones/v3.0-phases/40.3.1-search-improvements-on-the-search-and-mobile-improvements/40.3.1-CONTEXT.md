# Phase 40.3.1: Search & Mobile Improvements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Improve the search experience and mobile usability on the Explorer page (the sole discovery surface at `/`). Search bar and Sage both use the hybrid search system. The search bar provides autocomplete suggestions. Mobile layout, filters, and Sage panel are optimized for small screens.

## Implementation Decisions

### Search behavior
- Search bar and Sage both use the existing hybrid search system (FAISS + text matching)
- Live debounced dropdown (autocomplete) appears as user types (~300ms debounce)
- Suggestions are a classic dropdown list below the search bar (not inline cards)
- Suggestions show all searchable fields: categories, companies, domain tags, job titles
- Maximum 5 suggestions in the dropdown
- Selecting a suggestion fills the search bar text, then a full hybrid search runs
- Expert grid updates only on Enter press or suggestion click (not live as you type)
- Clearing the search bar (delete text or X button) removes the search term but keeps any active filter chips (rate, tags, saved, etc.)

### Mobile layout
- 2 expert cards per row on mobile (portrait phone)
- Header and search bar are sticky — always visible at top when scrolling
- Card content density at Claude's discretion (what fits well in 2-column grid)
- Tap behavior: first tap expands/highlights card with more details, second tap opens external profile link

### Filter experience (mobile)
- Filters accessed via bottom sheet — tap filter button, sheet slides up from bottom
- Active filters shown as dismissible chips between search bar and grid (chip row always visible)
- Bottom sheet auto-closes when a filter is applied (optimized for single-filter selection)
- Desktop filter sidebar remains as-is — bottom sheet is mobile-only alternative

### Sage on mobile
- FAB positioned at bottom-right corner (classic FAB position)
- Tapping FAB opens Sage as a fixed half-screen (~60%) bottom sheet
- Not draggable — always opens at fixed height, close button to dismiss
- After a discovery query returns results, bottom sheet auto-closes (~2s delay) so user sees the filtered grid

### Claude's Discretion
- Mobile card content density (what info to show/hide at 2-per-row)
- Suggestion dropdown styling and animation
- Bottom sheet implementation details (animation, backdrop)
- Exact debounce timing
- Loading states during search

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "The search bar as well as Sage should use our hybrid search system only, with the search bar providing suggestions"
- Suggestions should surface categories, companies, domain tags, job titles — not individual expert names
- Bottom sheet pattern for both filters and Sage on mobile — consistent mobile interaction model

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
