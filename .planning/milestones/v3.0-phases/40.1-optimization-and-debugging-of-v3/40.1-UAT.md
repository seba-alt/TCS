## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. BrowseCard Layout
expected: Cards on the Browse page display at a consistent, proper height. Photos or monogram initials fill the card area correctly — no clipping, no empty space, no layout collapse.
result: issue
reported: "the name and hour rate are not all on the same height, the first expert card of the categories should be a little away from the side"
severity: cosmetic

### 2. Hero Banner
expected: The hero section at the top of the Browse page shows an abstract purple/indigo gradient background. No individual expert profile photos appear in the banner.
result: pass
note: "pass but user suggests adding a slogan related to the category to fill open space"

### 3. FilterSidebar Domain Tags Label
expected: In the filter sidebar, the "Domain Tags" label text is clearly visible and readable (not invisible/white-on-white).
result: pass

### 4. Card Text Readability
expected: Expert names, hourly rates, and tag pills on BrowseCards are clearly readable against the card background — good contrast, no washed-out text.
result: pass

### 5. Browse Page Smooth Render
expected: When loading the Browse page, all rows appear together smoothly — no visible staggered/chunked row-by-row popping in.
result: pass

### 6. Back-Navigation Cache
expected: Navigate from Browse to Explorer (click an expert), then go back to Browse. The Browse page data loads instantly without a loading spinner or re-fetch delay.
result: pass

### 7. Visual Consistency (Browse vs Explorer)
expected: Browse and Explorer pages share the same brand identity — purple accent colors, consistent text colors, and similar visual styling. They feel like the same app.
result: pass

### 8. SeeAllEndCard Appearance
expected: The "See All" card at the end of each browse row has a light glass appearance that fits the aurora/light background theme (not dark/transparent).
result: pass

### 9. Browse Page Spacing
expected: The Browse page has adequate top spacing — content doesn't start cramped at the very top of the viewport.
result: pass
