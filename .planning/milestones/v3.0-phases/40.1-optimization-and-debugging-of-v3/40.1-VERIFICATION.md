# Phase 40.1 Verification: Optimization and Debugging of v3

## Phase Goal
Fix Browse page bugs (card sizing, hero banner, text contrast), optimize render performance (memoization, lazy loading, data caching), and perform visual consistency pass across Browse and Explorer pages aligned to Tinrate brand guidelines.

## Must-Have Verification

### Plan 40.1-01: Card & Banner Bug Fixes

| # | Must-Have | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | BrowseCard displays at consistent fixed height (220px collapsed, 260px expanded) with photo/monogram filling correctly | PASS | `initial={{ height: 220 }}` on line 66 of BrowseCard.tsx. minHeight removed. Absolute-inset children have proper containing block. |
| 2 | HeroBanner always shows abstract branded gradient — no expert profile photos attempted | PASS | No `current.photo_url` reference in HeroBanner.tsx. Photo conditional branch deleted. Only `HERO_GRADIENTS` gradient div rendered (line 62). |
| 3 | Text on BrowseCard (name, rate, tags) is clearly readable against all backgrounds | PASS | Overlay gradient darkened to `from-black/85 via-black/55` (line 88). Rate: `text-purple-200`. Tags: `bg-white/30 text-white`. |
| 4 | FilterSidebar 'Domain Tags' label is visible against glass-surface background | PASS | Changed from `text-white/60` to `text-gray-500` on line 39 of FilterSidebar.tsx. Matches 'Hourly Rate' label style. |
| 5 | Card images below the fold lazy-load instead of fetching all 40+ simultaneously | PASS | `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` on img element (line 78 of BrowseCard.tsx). |

### Plan 40.1-02: Performance Optimization + Visual Consistency

| # | Must-Have | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Browse page rows appear together in a single visual batch | PASS | BrowseCard wrapped with `memo()` (line 35 of BrowseCard.tsx). Prevents staggered re-renders as sibling rows mount. |
| 2 | Navigating Browse -> Explorer -> Browse shows cached data instantly | PASS | `browseData` field in NavigationSlice (line 45/63/67) with 5-min TTL. useBrowse.ts checks cache before fetch. |
| 3 | Browse and Explorer feel like the same app — consistent brand purple, coherent spacing, shared aurora background | PASS | BrowseRow titles: `text-gray-900`. SeeAllEndCard: `bg-white/60 border-gray-200/60`. "See All" buttons: `text-brand-purple`. Both pages use aurora-bg and brand-purple (#5128F2). |
| 4 | BrowseRow text uses brand-appropriate colors with adequate contrast on aurora | PASS | Row titles: `text-gray-900` (dark on light aurora). "See All": `text-brand-purple`. SeeAllEndCard text: `text-gray-800`. |
| 5 | Card content spacing feels balanced and not cramped | PASS | `leading-tight` on name, `mb-0.5` between rate and tags, `p-3` overlay padding, `pt-10 md:pt-14` page top padding. |

## Requirement Traceability

| Requirement | Status | Verified By |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| BROWSE-01 | PASS | Plan 02 — rows appear as unit, cached data on back-nav |
| BROWSE-02 | PASS | Plan 02 — consistent brand appearance |
| BROWSE-03 | PASS | Plan 01 — card height, text contrast fixed |
| BROWSE-04 | PASS | Plan 02 — brand-consistent colors |
| PHOTO-03 | PASS | Plan 01 — lazy loading, gradient-only hero |
| NAV-02 | PASS | Plan 02 — browse->explorer navigation with brand consistency |
