## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Landing page is Explorer
expected: Visit `/` — you see the expert grid with search bar and filters. No Browse page, no category rows, no hero banner. Just the Explorer.
result: pass

### 2. Route redirects
expected: Visit `/explore` — redirects to `/`. Visit `/browse` — redirects to `/`. Visit `/marketplace` — redirects to `/`. All three end up at the Explorer.
result: pass

### 3. Expert photos on cards
expected: Expert cards in the grid show profile photos (or monogram initials as fallback when no photo). Photos survived the Browse revert.
result: pass

### 4. Saved/bookmark feature
expected: Can click bookmark icon on expert cards to save them. Saved button visible in toolbar. Clicking Saved filters grid to show only bookmarked experts.
result: pass

### 5. Sage FAB and panel
expected: Sage FAB (floating action button) visible on the Explorer page. Clicking it opens the Sage conversation panel. Can type a message and get a response. Conversation persists if you close and reopen the panel.
result: pass

### 6. Sage discovery search
expected: Ask Sage to find experts (e.g. "find me a data scientist"). Sage responds and the expert grid updates to show matching results. Filter glow appears on FAB when Sage-driven filters are active.
result: pass

### 7. Header on mobile
expected: On mobile viewport (resize browser or use device): Header is visible (not hidden). Search bar is accessible. Header stays sticky at top when scrolling through experts.
result: pass

### 8. Toolbar features intact
expected: Clear All pill visible when filters are active — clicking it resets all filters. Search bar functional. All toolbar controls work as before the Browse revert.
result: pass
