# Phase 40.3: Revert to Explorer-only — remove Browse page, keep Explorer with adjustments - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Remove the Browse page introduced in v3.0 (phases 36-40.2) and make Explorer the sole discovery surface at `/`. Carry forward selected Browse-era improvements (photos, bookmarks, Sage, toolbar additions) into Explorer. Delete Browse-specific frontend components. Keep backend endpoints. Ensure mobile-first experience since 70% of traffic is mobile.

## Implementation Decisions

### What survives the revert
- Expert photos on cards stay — photo_url on Expert model, /api/photos endpoint, monogram fallback all kept
- Saved/bookmark feature stays — toolbar button + bookmark toggle on expert cards
- Sage stays as-is on Explorer — FAB, conversation persistence, discovery search integration
- All toolbar additions stay — Clear All pill, Saved button, Sage search integration
- Browse-style category rows do NOT carry over — drop categories entirely

### Explorer adjustments
- Straight to grid — no hero banner, no welcome header. User lands directly on search bar + expert grid
- Keep current Explorer card layout, just add photo/monogram to existing design (not Browse-style glassmorphic cards)
- Minor filter polish — Claude has discretion on visual rough edges but same filter functionality
- All 40.2 toolbar features stay intact

### Routing & entry point
- `/` serves Explorer directly — it's the only page
- `/browse` redirects permanently to `/`
- `/explore` redirect behavior — Claude's discretion (redirect to `/` or keep both working)
- `/marketplace` legacy redirect — Claude's discretion (clean up redirect chain)

### Backend cleanup
- Keep `/api/browse` endpoint for now — don't delete even though no frontend consumer
- Keep `/api/photos/{username}` proxy endpoint — photos staying on Explorer cards
- Keep admin bulk photo import endpoint — still useful
- Delete ALL Browse-specific frontend components (BrowsePage, CategoryRow, BrowseExpertCard, HeroBanner, useBrowseData hook)
- Zustand `navigationSlice` (pendingSageResults, navigationSource) — Claude's discretion on keep vs remove based on what Sage actually depends on

### Mobile responsiveness (70% of traffic is mobile)
- Search bar sticky at top of viewport — always accessible as user scrolls
- Two-column card grid on mobile — compact, see more experts
- Filters triggered via filter icon button → bottom sheet that slides up (thumb-friendly)
- Search and filters must be very easy to interact with on mobile

### Claude's Discretion
- `/explore` redirect behavior (redirect to `/` or keep working alongside)
- `/marketplace` redirect chain cleanup
- Zustand navigationSlice fate (keep for Sage or remove if unused)
- Filter sidebar visual polish specifics
- Exact mobile breakpoints and responsive transitions

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- 70% of traffic is mobile — mobile experience is the primary concern, not desktop
- Search must always be accessible on mobile (sticky top)
- Filters via bottom sheet pattern (slide up from bottom) for thumb-friendly interaction
- Two-column card grid on mobile for density
- Keep existing Explorer card design, don't adopt Browse glassmorphic style
