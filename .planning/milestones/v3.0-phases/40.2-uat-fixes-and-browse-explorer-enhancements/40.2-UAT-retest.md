## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. BrowseCard Bottom Alignment (retest)
expected: On the Browse page, all BrowseCards in a row should have their name, hourly rate, and tags pinned to the bottom — consistently aligned at the same height regardless of how many tags each card has.
result: pass

### 2. First Card Left Spacing (retest)
expected: The first card in each Browse row should sit clearly past the left fade overlay — visible content not hidden behind the gradient. Should work on both mobile and desktop.
result: issue
reported: "still the same as before"
severity: major

### 3. Clear All Pill in Sage Mode (retest)
expected: After performing a Sage AI search in the Explorer, the red "Clear All" pill should appear even though no filter chips are active. Clicking it exits Sage mode and resets to normal results.
result: pass

### 4. Bookmark Reactivity
expected: After clicking the bookmark icon on an ExpertCard, the Saved button count updates immediately without page refresh. The bookmark icon fills with purple instantly.
result: pass

### 5. Saved Button — Mobile
expected: On mobile, a dedicated Saved button appears in the top-right of the Explorer toolbar (next to Filters). Shows bookmark icon + count. Hides entirely when no experts are saved.
result: pass

### 6. Saved Button — Desktop
expected: On desktop, a "Saved (N)" pill appears above the FilterChips area, right-aligned. Active state shows brand-purple background. Hides entirely when no experts are saved.
result: pass

### 7. Saved Filter Toggle
expected: Clicking the Saved button filters the Explorer grid to show only bookmarked experts. Clicking again shows all experts.
result: pass
