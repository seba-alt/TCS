# Phase 50.2 Plan 02: OverviewPage analytics display cards Summary

**Admin overview dashboard analytics section with 3 stat counters (card clicks, searches, lead clicks) and 2 recent activity lists (explore searches, card clicks) wired to analytics-summary endpoint**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-02T00:05:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-02T00:08:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Added 3 analytics stat counter cards: Expert Card Clicks, Explore Searches, Lead Clicks (accent)
- Added RecentExploreSearchesCard showing query text, result count badge, and relative timestamp
- Added RecentCardClicksCard showing expert name (fallback to ID), source badge, and relative timestamp
- Graceful loading state (animated "...") and empty state with helpful messages
- Visual style consistent with existing OverviewPage cards

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Add analytics stat counters** — `b66d8d6` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add recent activity cards** — included in same commit (both tasks applied together)

## Files Created/Modified
- `frontend/src/admin/pages/OverviewPage.tsx` — Added useAnalyticsSummary hook call, 3 StatCard counters, RecentExploreSearchesCard + RecentCardClicksCard components

## Decisions Made
- Used StatCard (not TrendStatCard) for counters since no 7-day delta data is available yet
- Placed analytics counters between health strip and insight cards for high visibility
- Used emerald badge for result counts to visually distinguish from cyan/indigo source badges

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase complete, ready for verification
- All analytics cards render and handle empty/loading states
- Data will populate as soon as CORS is fixed on Railway and events start flowing
