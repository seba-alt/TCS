# Phase 50.2: Fix Search Tracking & Click Analytics Not Showing in Admin - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-03-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Diagnose and fix why search tracking and click analytics (built in Phase 50.1) are not visible in the admin overview. Verify all tracking works end-to-end on the deployed production site (Vercel + Railway). Add search query tracking if it doesn't exist yet.

## Implementation Decisions

### Diagnosis
- User searched AND clicked expert cards on the deployed production site
- Admin dashboard loads fine — experts, conversations visible — just no search/click analytics data anywhere
- Both the admin overview/dashboard AND individual expert expanded rows show nothing
- Issue is on production (Vercel frontend + Railway backend)

### Admin Overview Display
- Show totals + recent activity on the dashboard
- Total searches counter and total clicks counter
- List of recent searches and recent clicks

### Search Tracking Data
- Capture search queries + result counts (what people searched for and how many results they got)
- Add search query logging if it doesn't exist yet (Phase 50.1 focused on lead-click tracking)

### Expert Detail Display
- Claude's discretion on what click data to show per expanded expert row (at minimum something useful)

### Time Range / Filtering
- Claude's discretion on whether to show all-time or add date filtering

### Tracking Completeness
- Fix existing click tracking from 50.1
- Verify all tracking end-to-end
- Add search query tracking if missing
- Claude's discretion on what interactions to track beyond expert card clicks (e.g., contact actions)

### Claude's Discretion
- Expert detail row click data presentation
- Time range filtering approach
- Which click interactions to track beyond card clicks
- Verification approach (user will test manually on production)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- The admin overview should show both totals and recent activity — not just numbers, but what people actually searched/clicked
- Search tracking should capture the query text and how many results were returned
- User will manually verify on the live deployed site after fix
