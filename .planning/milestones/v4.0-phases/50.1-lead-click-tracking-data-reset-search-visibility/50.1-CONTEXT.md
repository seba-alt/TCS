# Phase 50.1: Lead Click Tracking, Data Reset & Search Bar Visibility - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Three focused improvements before public launch:
1. Admin visibility into which leads (identified by email) clicked on which experts
2. Clean database slate — wipe all conversations, leads, and analytics data (preserve expert data)
3. Make the search bar more visually prominent with a stronger border

## Implementation Decisions

### Click Tracking Display
- Track clicks only from identified leads (users who provided their email)
- Two views in admin: a dedicated "Leads" tab AND click data on each expert's detail page
- Leads tab: grouped by lead email, each lead as a header with their clicked experts listed underneath
- Data per click event: lead email, expert full name (First Last), timestamp, search query that led to the click
- Expert detail view: show which leads clicked on that specific expert

### Data Reset for Launch
- Full wipe of conversations.db — conversations, lead data, search/analytics history
- Preserve expert data: metadata.json, experts.csv, FAISS index untouched
- One-time script/migration — run before launch, no ongoing admin button needed

### Search Bar Visibility
- Current issue: border is too subtle, blends in
- Make the search bar itself more visually prominent (not the results)
- No focus state changes — same look whether focused or not, just make the default state more visible

### Expert Name Display in Admin
- Admin views only (not the public chatbot)
- Replace usernames completely with "First Last" format
- No username shown anywhere in admin — full name only

### Claude's Discretion
- Search bar border treatment approach (solid border, accent color, shadow, or combo — whatever makes it pop)
- Click tracking table/list styling and layout details
- Reset script implementation approach

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Leads tab should group by lead email with their clicked experts underneath (not a flat event table)
- Expert names from metadata.json "First Name" and "Last Name" fields
- Search bar should "pop out more" — user's words for wanting it to be more eye-catching

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
