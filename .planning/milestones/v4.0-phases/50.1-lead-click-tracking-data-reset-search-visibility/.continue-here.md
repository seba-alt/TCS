<current_state>
Phase 50.1 is fully executed and verified (15/15 must-haves). All 3 plans complete. Post-execution polish fixes were applied directly (not via GSD plans). Everything is deployed and working on production.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Phase 50.1 Execution (all 3 plans)
- Plan 50.1-01: LeadClick model, POST /api/lead-clicks capture endpoint, admin query endpoints (grouped by email + by-expert), ExpertCard click firing for newsletter-gated users
- Plan 50.1-02: Admin Leads tab click history (grouped by email), Experts page expandable click panel, AdminMarketplacePage expert name fix (First Last), search bar border visibility (border-2 border-slate-300 shadow-sm)
- Plan 50.1-03: scripts/reset_for_launch.py with dry-run safety

## Post-Execution Production Tasks
- Ran production DB reset via POST /api/admin/reset-data (50 rows wiped, expert data preserved)
- Ran batch industry tag assignment on production (540 experts tagged)
- Tested lead click tracking end-to-end on production (POST + GET endpoints working)

## Post-Execution UI Fixes
- Added industry tags to desktop FilterChips (same gray style as domain tags)
- Added click-based sort dropdown to desktop FilterChips bar
- Removed duplicate "real estate" from domain tags (already in industry tags as "Real Estate")
- Fixed TS build error (unused savedExperts variable)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

No remaining work for Phase 50.1. All features deployed and verified.

Potential follow-ups (not blocking):
- Monitor lead click tracking with real user traffic
- Consider adding admin reset button in future if needed (current: one-time script only)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Lead clicks: only track identified leads (email-gated users), grouped by email in admin
- Data reset: one-time script, not admin button; preserves expert data
- Search bar: border-2 border-slate-300 shadow-sm, no focus state changes
- Expert names: First Last replaces usernames in all admin views
- Industry tags: same visual style as domain tags on desktop (gray chips, not purple)
- Sort: click-based dropdown on desktop (hover didn't work reliably)
- Removed "real estate" from domain tags to avoid duplication with industry "Real Estate"
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — everything working on production.

<context>
Phase 50.1 was an urgent insertion after v4.0 shipped. All code is deployed on main, both Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend) are live. The user is preparing for public launch. Industry tags are now auto-assigned for new expert uploads (both add_expert and import_experts_csv call _auto_industry_tags).
