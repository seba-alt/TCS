# Requirements: Tinrate AI Concierge Chatbot

**Defined:** 2026-02-20
**Core Value:** A user describes any problem and instantly gets three expertly matched professionals they can contact — no searching, no filtering, no guesswork.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Chat Interface

- [x] **CHAT-01**: User can type a natural language problem description into an input field and submit it to the chatbot
- [x] **CHAT-02**: Frontend is mobile-responsive with stacked expert cards and a touch-friendly input area

*Note: CHAT-01 and CHAT-02 scaffold foundation established in 03-01 (Vite+React+Tailwind+types). Full implementation in 03-02 (components) and 03-03 (useChat hook + integration).*

### Expert Recommendations

- [x] **REC-01**: Backend embeds the user's query using Google GenAI (`text-embedding-004`) and semantically searches the expert CSV database
- [x] **REC-02**: Gemini LLM generates a conversational response recommending exactly 3 experts, each formatted as "Name — Job Title @ Company" followed by a "Why them:" explanation tailored to the user's problem
- [x] **REC-03**: Frontend renders 3 visual Expert Cards below the AI text response, displaying each expert's name, job title, company, and hourly rate
- [x] **REC-04**: Each Expert Card is a fully clickable link that routes the user directly to that expert's profile page on the Tinrate platform

### Deployment

- [x] **DEPL-01**: Application is publicly hosted and accessible via URL — React frontend on Vercel, FastAPI backend on Railway or Render

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Chat UX

- **UX-01**: Visible loading / thinking state while the AI processes the query (2–8 second calls)
- **UX-02**: Clarifying question flow — if query is too vague or narrow, chatbot asks one targeted follow-up before recommending
- **UX-03**: Example prompts displayed on empty state to reduce activation friction for new visitors
- **UX-04**: Error state messaging for API failures
- **UX-05**: Empty / no-match state when no experts meet minimum confidence threshold

### Differentiators

- **DIFF-01**: Multi-turn conversation history carryover across queries
- **DIFF-02**: Suggested follow-up prompt chips from Gemini
- **DIFF-03**: "Searching for: X" semantic query reformulation feedback

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User authentication / accounts | Zero v1 value; weeks of auth infrastructure |
| Expert profile management (CRUD) | CSV is static for v1; no admin UI needed |
| In-widget booking / scheduling | Booking happens on Tinrate profiles; no duplication |
| Mobile native app | Web-first; native app is a separate project |
| Filters sidebar | Defeats the concierge premise; natural language carries filter intent |
| Pagination / "show more" | Exactly 3 results is a deliberate product decision |
| In-widget feedback / ratings | No training loop or storage pipeline in v1 |
| OAuth / social login | Anonymous usage only for v1 |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| CHAT-01 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| CHAT-02 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| REC-01 | Phase 1 | Complete (human-verified 2026-02-20) |
| REC-02 | Phase 2 | Complete (human-verified 2026-02-20 — SSE streaming, 10+ domain queries, clarification path working) |
| REC-03 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| REC-04 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| DEPL-01 | Phase 4 | Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: 7 total
- Mapped to phases: 7
- Unmapped: 0 ✓
