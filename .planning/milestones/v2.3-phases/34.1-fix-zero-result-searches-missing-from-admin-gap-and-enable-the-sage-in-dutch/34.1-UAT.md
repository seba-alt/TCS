## Current Test
<!-- OVERWRITE each test - shows where we are -->

number: 5
name: Dutch query gets Dutch Sage response
expected: |
  Type a Dutch query in the Sage co-pilot (e.g., "Ik zoek een expert in data analyse"). Sage responds in Dutch. Expert names, job titles, and company names remain in English within the Dutch response.
awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Admin gap counter includes zero-candidate searches
expected: In the Admin Overview page, the gap count includes searches where no FAISS candidates were found (NULL top_match_score). The total gap count should be higher than before if any such searches exist.
result: pass

### 2. Gaps page shows zero-candidate searches
expected: On the Admin Gaps page, searches with no FAISS candidates appear in the table. These rows should show a dash or "—" for best score instead of a numeric value.
result: pass

### 3. Searches page gap filter catches zero-candidate searches
expected: On the Admin Searches page, filtering by gap_flag=true includes zero-candidate searches. Filtering by gap_flag=false excludes them.
result: pass

### 4. Gap CSV export includes zero-candidate searches
expected: Exporting gaps to CSV includes rows for zero-candidate searches alongside low-score searches.
result: pass

### 5. Dutch query gets Dutch Sage response
expected: Type a Dutch query in the Sage co-pilot (e.g., "Ik zoek een expert in data analyse"). Sage responds in Dutch. Expert names, job titles, and company names remain in English within the Dutch response.
result: [pending]

### 6. English query still works normally
expected: Type an English query in Sage (e.g., "Find me a data analyst"). Sage responds in English as before — no change in behavior.
result: [pending]
