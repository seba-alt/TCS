<objective>
Human verification of the complete expert grid — visual appearance of cards, entry animations, infinite scroll behavior, tag pill click wiring, and empty state.

Purpose: The grid is the primary browsing interface. Visual correctness, animation feel, and interactive behaviors (infinite scroll, tag click) must be confirmed by a human before Phase 18 builds on this foundation.

Output: Human-approved expert grid ready for Phase 18 co-pilot integration.

  <name>Task 1: Start dev servers and confirm build passes</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Start both dev servers if not already running:
- Backend: from /Users/sebastianhamers/Documents/TCS/ run: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000 (run in background)
- Frontend: from /Users/sebastianhamers/Documents/TCS/frontend/ run: npm run dev (run in background)

Confirm the build is clean: from frontend/ run npm run build — must exit 0.
Confirm the dev server is reachable: curl -s http://localhost:5173 should return HTML (or whichever port Vite chose — check terminal output).
Confirm the backend is reachable: curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health should return {"status":"ok",...}.
  </action>
  <verify>
    npm run build exits 0 with no errors.
    curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health returns JSON with status: "ok".
    Dev server is running and accessible in browser.

  <what-built>
    Complete Phase 17 expert grid: VirtuosoGrid with ExpertCard, entry animations, infinite scroll, tag pill filter wiring, and EmptyState. Integrated into MarketplacePage replacing the Phase 16 placeholder div.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Open http://localhost:5173 in browser (or the port Vite printed in terminal).

    1. CARD CONTENT: Confirm expert cards display all required fields — full name (first + last), job title, company, hourly rate with currency symbol (e.g. "USD 150/hr"), up to 3 domain tag pills as clickable buttons. Confirm at least some cards show a green "Top Match" or "Good Match" badge.

    2. CARD ANIMATIONS: Reload the page. Watch the initial card load — cards should slide up slightly from below and fade in. Cards should appear in sequence with a small stagger (not all at once). Observe the animation is smooth and completes within ~400ms.

    3. GRID LAYOUT: On desktop, confirm 3-column layout. Resize browser to mobile width (less than 768px) and confirm 2-column layout. Cards should have uniform height with truncated text (not variable heights).

    4. INFINITE SCROLL: Confirm total expert count shown in the filter chips area. Scroll slowly to the bottom of the grid. A row of skeleton cards should appear briefly at the bottom, then a new batch of experts should append below existing ones (existing experts stay in place — they are NOT replaced). Repeat scrolling until no more experts load.

    5. TAG PILL CLICK: Click any domain tag pill on any expert card. Confirm: (a) a filter chip for that tag appears in the filter chip strip above the grid, (b) the grid re-fetches and results update to show only experts with that tag, and (c) the new cards animate in fresh.

    6. FILTER + CARD RE-FETCH: Type a search query in the search input (e.g. "marketing"). Confirm the grid shows new results and the match reason snippet appears below tag pills on cards where the search matched. Remove the search — match reasons disappear.

    7. EMPTY STATE: Apply a very specific filter combination unlikely to match any expert (e.g. rate max = 10 and a specific tag). If no experts match, confirm the empty state illustration + message + "Try the AI Co-Pilot" button appears instead of a blank area.

    8. LOADING STATE: Hard-reload the page (Cmd+Shift+R). Confirm the skeleton grid (pulsing placeholder cards) appears briefly before real cards load.

- Entry animations are smooth slide-up + fade with visible stagger
- Infinite scroll appends new experts without replacing existing ones
- Tag pill click adds tag to filter chips and triggers re-fetch
- Empty state shown when no results
- Loading skeleton shown on initial page load
