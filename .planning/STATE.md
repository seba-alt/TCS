## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v3.0 scoping: Billboard Hero (BROWSE-05), aurora page transitions (NAV-03/NAV-04), and Sage navigate_to function (SAGE-05) deferred to v2 requirements
- v3.0 architecture: navigationSlice is ephemeral (not persisted) — sageMode must be set BEFORE navigate() to prevent competing 530-expert fetch on Explorer mount
- Phase 36: resetPilot() gated by navigationSource — direct=reset, browse/sage=preserve (highest-risk change resolved)
- Phase 36: pendingSageResults stores full Expert objects (not IDs) — matches existing resultsSlice pattern
- Phase 36: MarketplaceRedirect uses useSearchParams for query param preservation in SPA redirect
- Phase 37: Photo proxy uses StreamingResponse (not redirect) — preserves HTTPS enforcement and cache control
- Phase 37: Browse card photo_url points to /api/photos/{username} proxy (not raw stored URL)
- Phase 37: Case-insensitive name matching for bulk photo CSV import

### Pending Todos

- Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://tcs-three-sigma.vercel.app` in Railway environment variables (carried over from v1.1)
- Verify FTS5 availability on Railway SQLite at startup

### Blockers/Concerns

None — photo backend is ready for Browse UI consumption
