## Gap Analysis

### Phase 48: Missing Verification Artifacts

Phase 48 was executed (4 git commits: `762c02d`, `c67477c`, `843c2a4`, `acbb0b4`) and marked complete in STATE.md (4/4 plans). However, **no SUMMARY.md or VERIFICATION.md files were generated**. This means 6 requirements (ADM-01, ADM-02, ADM-05, DISC-01, DISC-02, DISC-03) lack formal verification.

**Integration checker finding:** All 6 requirements are wired end-to-end in the source code. The gap is **procedural** (missing verification documents), not **functional** (code is present and integrated).

**Recommendation:** Generate Phase 48 VERIFICATION.md to close this gap. No code changes needed.

## Integration Verification

All 19 requirements have verified cross-phase integration:

| Integration Point | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Phase 45→46: JWT auth + lazy-loaded admin routes | WIRED |
| Phase 45→48: JWT auth + new admin endpoints | WIRED |
| Phase 45→49: JWT auth + overview page fetches | WIRED |
| Phase 46→47: Lazy loading does not affect public routes | WIRED |
| Phase 47→48: Industry tags + grid/list view | WIRED |
| Phase 48→49: Overview cards coexist without conflict | WIRED |

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Public search: explorer → search → grid/list results → expert profile | COMPLETE |
| Admin login: /admin → lazy load → credentials → JWT → admin panel | COMPLETE |
| Admin data: overview → stat cards + recent leads/searches → detail pages | COMPLETE |
| Lead export: leads page → CSV export → download with queries/clicks | COMPLETE |
| Industry filter: explorer → tag cloud → industry tag → filtered results | COMPLETE |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 45: Security + Infrastructure
- REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes not updated for SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03, ADM-03

### Phase 46: Frontend Performance
- Suspense fallback replaces full admin frame during inter-page navigation (cosmetic)

### Phase 47: Public Explorer Polish
- REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes not updated for EXP-01 through EXP-06

### Phase 48: Admin Features + Industry Tags
- No SUMMARY.md files for any of the 4 plans
- No VERIFICATION.md for the phase
- REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes not updated for 6 requirements
- Industry tags not auto-seeded on fresh deployments (manual trigger required)

**Total: 10 tech debt items across 4 phases**
