## Integration Verification

All 19 requirements have verified cross-phase integration:

| Integration Point | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Phase 45→46: JWT auth + lazy-loaded admin routes | WIRED |
| Phase 45→48: JWT auth + new admin endpoints (stats, export, import) | WIRED |
| Phase 45→49: JWT auth + overview page fetches (leads, searches) | WIRED |
| Phase 46→47: Lazy loading does not affect public routes | WIRED |
| Phase 47→48: Industry tags + grid/list view | WIRED |
| Phase 48→49: Overview cards coexist with recent leads/searches | WIRED |

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Public search: explorer → search → grid/list results → expert profile | COMPLETE |
| Admin login: /admin → lazy load → credentials → JWT → admin panel | COMPLETE |
| Admin data: overview → stat cards + recent leads/searches → detail pages | COMPLETE |
| Lead export: leads page → CSV export → download with queries/clicks | COMPLETE |
| Industry filter: explorer → tag cloud → industry tag → filtered results | COMPLETE |
| CSV import: experts page → drag-drop CSV → preview → column mapping → import → FAISS rebuild | COMPLETE |
| Unknown admin route: /admin/anything → catch-all → redirect to /admin | COMPLETE |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 46: Frontend Performance
- Suspense fallback replaces full admin frame during inter-page navigation (cosmetic)

### Phase 48: Admin Features + Industry Tags
- No SUMMARY.md files for any of the 4 plans (requirements_completed frontmatter missing)
- `POST /api/admin/experts/assign-industry-tags` endpoint has no frontend button — existing 530 experts may lack industry tags until manually triggered

**Total: 3 tech debt items across 2 phases (none are blockers)**
